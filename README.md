# Introduction
Yahboom new IMU sensor modules integrate multi-axis MEMS sensors, serving as the core for motion tracking and attitude measurement. Built with a high-performance 32-bit 72MHz processor, support real-time attitude calculation and dynamic compensation. It can deeply integrate data from gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers to output precise attitude angles (roll, pitch, and yaw) and 3-axis acceleration information. Whether 6-axis dynamic initialization or 9-axis or 10-axis full-scale sensing with magnetometers and barometers, it can provide stable, reliable, and high-precision motion data solutions for your DIY robots, drones, smart agriculture, and navigation applications.
# Features
* Multi-Axis Options for Precise Positioning
  6-Axis: Integrate 3-axis gyroscopes and 3-axis accelerometers provide precise measurement of angular velocity and linear acceleration, offering a cost-effective solution.

  9-Axis: Add a 3-axis magnetometer to the 6-axis module unlocks absolute heading (heading angle) and eliminates long-term drift.

  10-Axis: Add a high-precision barometer on a 9-axis basis enables altitude measurement, making it suitable for applications requiring more precise 3D attitude and position perception.
* Advanced Algorithm, Stable Attitude

  Built-in professional sensor fusion algorithm directly outputs gyroscope, acceleration, Euler angles, and quaternion data, significantly reducing the burden on the host MCU.
* Supports IIC/Serial Communication, Excellent Compatibility

  Yahboom IMU module supports Type-C and pin header connections. It supports both IIC and UART communication protocols and features a wide 3.3V/5V input voltage. Can connect to a PC for debugging or working with mainstream development platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, STM32, ESP32, Jetson, RDK, and MSPM0.
* Wide Applicability, Endless Possibilities

  From robot balancing and navigation, drone flight control, to IoT device attitude monitoring, Yahboom IMU modules is the ideal core component for intelligent motion control, providing a solid data foundation for your innovative applications.
